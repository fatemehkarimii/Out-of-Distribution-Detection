Robust Detection of Out-of-Distribution Shifts in Chest X-ray Imaging(https://doi.org/10.1007/s10278-025-01559-7): Designed and implemented a
deep-learning GAN framework for OOD detection in chest X-ray imaging; performed extensive data analysis and
hypothesis testing (Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov p-value thresholding), optimized latent representations via
gradient-based methods, and achieved 97.5% accuracy with 100% precision.
